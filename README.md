## Why is limousine rental expensive? What makes it so special?

There is actually no clear answer to these questions because the answer to those questions
can be subjective and dependent to the person asking the question.

For some, the cost of limousine rental is worth it because of comfort and style. For others,
a limousine is simply a car that would get you from point A to point B and nothing more.
For the average person, a limousine would seem like a dream because they rarely see one,
much less ride in one. For those reason, they generally would pay more because they
associate limousines with prestige and class.

## Comfort and style

Limousines are rare vehicles which makes them special. You can actually count in your hands
how many times you've seen a limousine riding around town. When you do actually see them,
most of the time, the passengers are going to some big events like weddings or proms. You
probably won't see someone riding in a limo to pick up their daughter from school. It's a
special car that is reserved only for the best occasions.

If you've ridden in a limo before, you should already know the comfort it offers. It has
stylish interior that is considerably roomier than even big SUVs. Most limousines also
have the latest infotainment system to give passengers the best entertainment possible.
Apart from all of that, limousines offer the best ride comfort out of all car rentals you
can think of.

If you think those qualities justify the price of renting a limo, by all means, rent one and
experience it yourself. If you are not a limo guy, you can still enjoy riding inside a limo
for the experience alone. It is a great vehicle that you will surely enjoy.
